`int dimport(string name, <type>&out)`

Reads a variable from the displacement shader for the surface.

Mantra runs the shaders for a surface in a fixed order:

1. Displacement
2. Surface (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)
3. Fog (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)

Once the displacement shader has run, you can use `dimport`
to retrieve exported variables from it. Once the surface shader
has run, you can use [simport](simport.html) ("Imports a variable sent by a surface shader in an illuminance loop.") to retrieve exported variables
from it.

If the shader variable named by the first argument is defined and
exported, the function returns 1 and puts the value in the second
argument. Otherwise, it returns 0.
