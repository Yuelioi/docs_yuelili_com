This function lets you walk the points connected to a point (separated by a single edge). To get a list of all connected points at once, use [neighbours](neighbours.html) ("Returns an array of the point numbers of the neighbours of a point.").

`int neighbour(<geometry>geometry, int point_num, int neighbour_num)`

## Arguments

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an `op:/path/to/sop` reference.

`point_num`

The number of the point whose neighbours you want to find.

`neighbour_num`

Which neighbour to find. The neighbours are in no particular order. Use [neighbourcount](neighbourcount.html) ("Returns the number of points that are connected to the specified point.") to get the total number of connected points.

## Returns

The point index of the neighbour of the point. The order is undefined, but will be consistent for consistent geometry. Returns `-1` if the `neighbournum` is out of range for that point, or the point is out of range for that input, or the input doesnâ€™t exist.
