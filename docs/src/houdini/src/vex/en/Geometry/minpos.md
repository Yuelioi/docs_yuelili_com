`vector minpos(<geometry>geometry, vector point)`

Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point.

`vector minpos(<geometry>geometry, vector point, float maxdist)`

Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
within the maxdist radius.

`vector minpos(<geometry>geometry, string primgroup, vector point)`

Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
limiting the search to primitives in the named group.

`vector minpos(<geometry>geometry, string primgroup, vector point, float maxdist)`

Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
limiting the search to primitives in the named group and to the maxdist radius.

## Arguments

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an `op:/path/to/sop` reference.

`primgroup`

If specified, only report points on
You can also use group specification syntax like `@Cd.x>0`,
but note that the `@` may need to be escaped with a backslash in a Wrangle snippet.
An empty string matches all primitives.

`point`

The point in world space to start looking for the closest point on the geometry.

`maxdist`

The maximum distance to search. Specifying this can speed up the function since it may allow quitting the search early.

## Returns

The position of the nearest point on the geometry, or point if no nearest point was found.
