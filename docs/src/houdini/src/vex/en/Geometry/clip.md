`void clip(int &result, vector &p0, vector &p1, vector4 plane)`

clip the line segment against an arbitrary 3D plane specified by the
plane equation (plane.x\*x + plane.y\*y + plane.z\*z + plane.w).

`void clip(int &result, vector &p0, vector &p1, vector min, vector max)`

clip the line segment to the bounding box specified by the min and max
corner points.

clip the line segment between p0 and p1.

If the line is entirely clipped out of the result will be set to 0.
otherwise, the values p0 and p1 will be clipped to the constraints
specified and the result will be 1.
