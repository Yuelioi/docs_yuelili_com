`void noised(float x, float &v, float &dvdx)`

`void noised(float x, vector &v, vector &dvdx)`

`void noised(float x, float y, float &v, float &dvdx, float &dvdy)`

`void noised(float x, float y, vector &v, vector &dvdx, vector &dvdy)`

`void noised(vector xyz, float &v, float &dvdx, float &dvdy, float &dvdz)`

`void noised(vector xyz, vector &v, vector &dvdx, vector &dvdy, vector &dvdz)`

`void noised(vector4 xyzw, float &v, float &dvdx, float &dvdy, float &dvdz, float &dvdw)`

`void noised(vector4 xyzw, vector &v, vector &dvdx, vector &dvdy, vector &dvdz, vector &dvdw)`

This computes both the perlin noise value, and the derivatives of the
noise along each axis. This can be performed quite efficiently as
there are analytic derivatives available.

guide for more information.
