This computes both the simplex noise value, and the derivatives of the
noise along each axis. This can be performed quite efficiently as
there are analytic derivatives available.

See [xnoise](xnoise.html) ("Simplex noise is very close to Perlin noise, except with the samples on a simplex mesh rather than a grid. This results in less grid artifacts. It also uses a higher order bspline to provide better derivatives.") and [pxnoise](pxnoise.html) ("Simplex noise is very close to Perlin noise, except with the samples on a simplex mesh rather than a grid. This results in less grid artifacts. It also uses a higher order bspline to provide better derivatives. This is the periodic simplex noise") for other versions of xnoise.

See [noise and randomness](../random.html) in the VEX language
guide for more information.
