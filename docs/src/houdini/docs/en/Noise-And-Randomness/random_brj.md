When generating a sequence of random numbers you will notice that it tends to
clump. However, sometimes you want a bunch of samples that are better distributed. A binary random jittered (BRJ) sample is a series of random numbers which are relatively evenly distributed, similar to `random_sobol()`.

The seed allows you to generate different sequences. If it is a floating point seed, note very small differences will select very different sequences.

The offset is which entry in the sequence to extract. This should be an integer sequence, like `ptnum`, in order for the distribution property to work.

Each number is in the `[0..1)` range.
