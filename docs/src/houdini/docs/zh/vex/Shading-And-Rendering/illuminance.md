## 概述

[¶](#overview)

// 需要缩进这个，以便下面的 include 不会在这个标题下。

```c
illuminance(position, [axis], [angle], [light\_typemask], [lightmask])
{
 // Here, Cl and L will be set to the value/direction for the
 // current light source.
 // To force the shadow shader to be called, use:
 // shadow(Cl);
}

```

The shadow shader is not called unless you explicitly call it. However, once the shadow shader has been called, the value of `Cl` will be changed for the duration of the surface shader. The shadow shader is automatically called when using any of the built-in lighting calls (e.g. [diffuse](diffuse.html) () ("Returns a diffuse BSDF or computes diffuse shading."), [specular](specular.html) () ("Returns a specular BSDF or computes specular shading."), [ambient](ambient.html) () ("Returns the color of ambient light in the scene.")).

The default value for the axis is the surface normal. The default value for the angle is PI/2. The default value for the light mask is LIGHT_DIFFUSE|LIGHT_SPECULAR (please see shading.h for the light definitions).

The `illuminance` statement loops through all light sources for which `dot(L, axis) > cos(angle)`.

## Light inclusion/exclusion options

[¶](#light-inclusion-exclusion-options)

## Arguments

"`categories`",
`string`
`="*"`

Specifies lights to include/exclude by their “category” tags.
This is the preferred include/exclude lights rather than pattern matching
light names with the `"lightmask"` keyword argument.

For example:

```c
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "hero fill");

```

See [light categories](../../render/lights.html) () (#categories) for more information.

"`lightmask`",
`string`
`="*"`

When evaluating light and shadow shaders, objects have pre-defined light
masks. This mask is usually specified in the geometry object and
specifies a list of lights which are used to illuminate a surface or fog
shader. It is possible to override the default light mask by specifying
a “lightmask” argument.

For example:

```c
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "light\*,^light2");

```

…will cause all lights whose names begin with “light” except for a
light named “light2” to be considered for diffuse illumination.

All Houdini scoping patterns, excepting group expansion, are supported:

- `*` - wild-card match
- `?` - single character match
- `^` - exclusion operator
- `[list]` - character list match

## Sending information to the light’s shader

[¶](#sending-information-to-the-light-s-shader)

You can give additional pairs of string/value arguments to `illuminance` to pass named values to each light’s shader. For example, to pass the value of the `N` variable as `orgN`:

```c
illuminance (P, nf, M\_PI/2, "orgN", N) {
...
}

```

In the light’s shader, you can receive the value from the illuminance loop with the [simport](simport.html) () ("Imports a variable sent by a surface shader in an illuminance loop.") function.

```c
vector orgN;
simport("orgN", orgN);

```

The `simport` function returns 1 if the import succeeds and 0 otherwise, so you can use it as the condition in an `if` statement.

Here’s a full example:

```c
surface
exporter()
{
vector nf = frontface(normalize(N), I);
Cf = 0;
illuminance(P, nf, M\_PI/2, "orgN", N)
{
Cf += Cl;
}

light
importer()
{
vector orgN;
if (!simport("orgN", orgN))
orgN = N;
// Use original N
Cl = orgN;
}

```

## Message passing

[¶](#message-passing)

Within the illuminance loop, you can retrieve values from the light shader
with the [limport](limport.html) () ("Imports a variable from the light shader for the surface.") function.

The light shader can retrieve any “keyword” arguments passed to the illuminance
statement with the [simport](simport.html) () ("Imports a variable sent by a surface shader in an illuminance loop.") function.

For example, to send down the vector variable `uv` to the light shader…

```c
vector uv = set(s, t, 0);
illuminance(P, dir, "uv", uv) { ... }

```

The light shader would be able to read this using…

```c
vector uv;
if (simport("uv", uv))
printf("Imported: %g from surface\n", uv);

```

## lightexport keyword argument

[¶](#lightexport-keyword-argument)

You can supply the extra string argument `"lightexport"` followed by
a string argument containing the name(s) of the exported variables to
assign within the loop.

In some shaders, multiple illuminance loops are used to define different
light contributions. The `lightexport` argument is useful in these cases
to specify which variables should be exported from the different
loops.

The `lightexport` value can be a space-separated list of wildcard
patterns. For example, `illuminance(pos, dir, "lightexport", "Front*")`
exports variables whose names start with `Front`.

```c
surface
light\_export\_test(export vector diff=0;
export vector spec=0)
{
vector nn = normalize(frontface(N, I));
vector vv = -normalize(I);
vector clr;

Cf = 0;
// This illuminance loop only exports to the "diff" variable
illuminance(P, nn, "lightexport", "diff")
{
clr = Cl \* diffuseBRDF(normalize(L), nn);
Cf += clr;
diff = clr;
}
// This illuminance loop only exports to the "spec" variable
illuminance(P, nn, "lightexport", "spec")
{
clr = Cl \* specularBRDF(normalize(L), nn, vv, 0.1);
Cf += clr;
spec = clr;
}

```
