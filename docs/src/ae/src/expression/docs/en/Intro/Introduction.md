## Description

# Introduction

Use the After Effects expression elements along with standard JavaScriptelements to write your expressions. You can use the Expression Language menuat any time to insert methods and attributes into an expression, and you canuse the pick whip at any time to insert properties.

If an argument description contains an equal sign (=) and a value (such ast=time or width=.2), then the argument uses the included default value if youdon’t specify a different value.

Some argument descriptions include a number in square brackets—this numberindicates the dimension of the expected property or Array.

Some return-value descriptions include a number in square brackets—this numberspecifies the dimension of the returned property or Array. If a specificdimension is not included, the dimension of the returned Array depends on the
dimension of the input.

The W3Schools JavaScript reference website provides information for thestandard JavaScript language, including pages for the JavaScript Math and
String objects.
