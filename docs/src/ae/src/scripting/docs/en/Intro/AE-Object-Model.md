## The After Effects Object Model

As you look through this reference section, which is organized alphabeticallyby object, you can refer to the following diagrams for an overview of wherethe various objects fall within the hierarchy, and their correspondence to the
user interface.

Hierarchy diagram of the main After Effects scripting objects

Note that the [File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html), Folder, and Socket objects are defined byExtendScript, and are documented in the [JavaScript ToolsGuide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/). ExtendScript also defines theScriptUI module, a set of window and user-interface control objects, which areavailable to After Effects scripts. These are also documented in the[JavaScript Tools Guide](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/). Thehierarchy of objects in scripting corresponds to the hierarchy in the user
interface.

The application contains a Project panel, which displays a project. Theproject contains compositions, which contain layers. The source for a layercan be a footage file, placeholder, or solid, also listed in the Projectpanel. Each layer contains settings known as properties, and these can containmarkers and keyframes. The renderqueue contains render-queue items as well asrender settings and output modules. All of these entities are represented by
objects in scripting.

::: info Note

To avoid ambiguity, this manual uses the term “attribute” to refer toJavaScript object properties, and the term “property” or “AE property” torefer to After Effects layer properties.
