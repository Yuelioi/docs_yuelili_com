## Collection object

Like an array, a collection associates a set of objects or values as a logicalgroup and provides access to them by index. However, most collection objectsare read-only. You do not assign objects to them yourself—their contentsupdate automatically as objects are created or deleted.

::: info Note

The index numbering of a collection starts with 1, not 0.
