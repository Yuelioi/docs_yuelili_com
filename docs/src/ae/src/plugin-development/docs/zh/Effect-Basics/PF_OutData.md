| `num_params`                | After Effects checks this field against the number of calls made toPF_ADD_PARAM, as well as the implicit input layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `sequence_data`             | Allocatable upon receiving [PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) , this handle will be passed back to you in effect-basics/PF_InData during all subsequent calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `flat_sdata_size`           | Unused (After Effects knows the size, because you used its allocation functions to get the memory in the first place).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `frame_data`                | Handle you (might have) allocated during [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) .This is never written to disk; it was used to pass information from your [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) response to your [PF_Cmd_RENDER](effect-basics/command-selectors) or [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETDOWN](effect-basics/command-selectors) (which you must do if you resize the output buffer).Otherwise, this memory is rarely used. |
| `width`, `height`, `origin` | Set during [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) if the output image size differs from the input.`width` and `height` are the size of the output buffer, and `origin` is the point the input should map to in the output.To create a 5-pixel drop shadow up and left, set origin to (5, 5).                                                                                                                                            |

## PF_OutFlags

这些标志向 After Effects 传递能力和状态信息。在以前的版本中，它们也被用来发送基本信息，例如刷新用户界面，发送错误信息。

这些能力已经被功能套件所取代，所有新的信息传递功能都将采用这种格式。然而，能力标志仍然包含在 [PiPL](introduction/pipl-resources) 中。

当你做出改变时，请同时更新 PiPL 和你的源代码。这些标志中有许多可以在 After Effects 会话中改变。

| `PF_OutFlag_NON_PARAM_VARY`                  | With this flag set, After Effects will not cache output when the effect is applied to a still.Otherwise, After Effects will cache your output to be used to render other frames, if possible.Set this flag if output varies based on something besides a parameter value.If the effect produces changing frames when applied to a still image and all parameters are constant, that's a sure sign that this bit should be set (e.g. Wave Warp).Particle effects, for example, will need this.Set during[PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) .Can be overridden dynamically if needed during [PF_Cmd_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS](effect-basics/command-selectors) .Turn this off whenever possible to improve performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `PF_OutFlag_AUDIO_IIR`                       | Set during[PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) if the (audio) effect is an Infinite Impulse Response filter.This is true if output at a given time depends on output from previous times.When an IIR filter receives [PF_Cmd_AUDIO_RENDER](effect-basics/command-selectors) , the input audio time span is the same as the output audio time span (when they intersect with the output time span requested in [PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) ).In response to [PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) , the filter can request audio from earlier times (as for delay effects).The filter can access parameters from that earlier time, and should cache them (along with interim audio) in sequence data.If the audio generated does not correspond to the requested output audio's time, the output audio duration should be set to zero.The filter can update its delay line using the parameters and the input audio.Having cached its delay line, request more input audio during [PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) based on the last cached delay line.

## PF_OutFlags2

我们在 After Effects 5.0 中增加了第二套输出标志；一方面是为了在将来有扩展的空间，另一方面是为了打破自己重复使用现有标志的坏习惯。

与 "PF_OutFlags "一样，这些标志中的许多都可以在 After Effects 会话中改变。

当你做出改变时，不要忘记更新[PiPL](introduction/pipl-resources)和你的源代码。

| `PF_OutFlag2_REVEALS_ZERO_ALPHA`                         | This is the one flag implementors need to pay most attention to since it represents a change in the default behavior.Set this flag if the effect can take pixels with zero alpha and reveal the RGB data in them (like our Set Channels effect).This tells After Effects not to trim such pixels when determining the input for the effect.This flag can be changed during[PF_Cmd_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS](effect-basics/command-selectors) .Note that, while this flag can cause changes to the size of the `extent_hint`, it will not change the image buffer size.As of 6.0, pixels outside the mask's bounding box are zeroed.If your effect can reveal such pixels, tell AE not to throw away these RGB values by setting this flag.If your effect does not always reveal such pixels, set this bit dynamically.To see if your effect needs this bit set, apply a mask significantly smaller than the layer to a solid, then apply the effect and set it to its alpha-modifying state.If the rectangular bounding box of the mask becomes visible, this bit needs to be set.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `PF_OutFlag2_AUTOMATIC_WIDE_TIME_INPUT`                  | Set during[PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP](effect-basics/command-selectors) .Requires setting of `PF_OutFlag_WIDE_TIME_INPUT` (which allows you to support old hosts), but effectively overrides that flag.When set, all parameter checkouts are tracked so over-time dependencies are known by the host, and much more efficient.For example, if you set only the old `PF_OutFlag_WIDE_TIME_INPUT`, anytime anything changes at any time upstream from your effect, you will be called to re-render.With this flag set, if a given frame 17 has checked out things from times 0-17, AE will know that any changes at frames 18+ will not affect that cached frame.Note that if you use this new flag, you must not cache any time-dependent data in your sequence data (or anywhere else), unless you also validate that [cache](effect-details/global-sequence-frame-data.validating-sequence-data) using `PF_GetCurrentState()` / `PF_AreStatesIdentical()` from effect-detals/parameter-supervision.PF_ParamUtilSuite before using the time-dependent data.This only works for SmartFX (those that set `PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_SMART_RENDER`).If you haven't set that, After Effects will silently treat this as `PF_OutFlag_WIDE_TIME_INPUT` instead. |
