# Useful Utility Functions

## PF_EffectUISuite

Although not strictly concerned with parameters, this suite can change the name of the options button.

### PF_SetOptionsButtonName

Changes the text on the options button in the effect controls palette.

NOTE: This must be called during [PF_Cmd_PARAM_SETUP](../effect-basics/command-selectors.html).

```cpp
PF_SetOptionsButtonName(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
constA_char*nameZ);
```

nameZ` may be up to A_char[31]` in length.

## PF_AppSuite

Roughly 437 years ago, when we released After Effects 5.0, we published some useful utility callbacks in PF_AppSuite. They’re as useful today as they were then. After Effects has user-controllable UI brightness.

In addition to the [PF_EffectCustomUIOverlayThemeSuite](../effect-ui-events/custom-ui-and-drawbot.html) (#effect-ui-events-custom-ui-and-drawbot-pf-effectcustomuioverlaythemesuite) for custom UI in effects, use these calls to integrate seamlessly into the After Effects UI.

What better way to shame someone into purchasing a copy of your plug-in than by putting their personal information into a watermark, eh? Or set the cursor to add mask vertices, just to confuse people? Heh heh heh. But that would be wrong.

### PF_AppGetBgColor

Retrieves the current background color.

```cpp
PF_AppGetBgColor(
PF_App_Colorbg_colorP);
```

### PF_AppGetColor

Retrieves the color for the specified UI element. See AE_EffectSuites.h for a complete enumeration of available PF_App_Color` values; basically any color in After Effects’ UI can be retrieved.

CC adds several new PF_App_ColorType` enum values for new elements that can be queried.

Note that in CS6, the color definitions are off from FILL_LIGHT` downward.

Use following psuedocode for CS6 only:

```cpp
GetColor(enume)
{
ifhost_is_CS6ande>=FILL_LIGHT
e+=3
callrealGetColor
}

PF_AppGetColor(
PF_App_ColorTypecolor_type,
PF_App_Color*app_colorP);
```

### PF_AppGetLanguage

New in CC. Retrieves the active displayed language of AE UI so plug-in can match. Here are the possible language codes as of CC:

- Chinese - zh_CN`
- English - en_US`
- French - fr_FR`
- German - de_DE`
- Italian - it_IT`
- Japanese - ja_JP`
- Korean - ko_KR`
- Spanish - es_ES`

```cpp
PF_AppGetLanguage(
A_charlang_tagZ);
```

### PF_GetPersonalInfo

Retrieves the user’s registration information.

```cpp
PF_GetPersonalInfo(
PF_AppPersonalTextInfo*ptiP);

typedefstructPF_AppPersonalTextInfo{
A_charname[PF_APP_MAX_PERS_LEN+1];
A_charorg[PF_APP_MAX_PERS_LEN+1];
A_charserial_str[PF_APP_MAX_PERS_LEN+1];
}PF_AppPersonalTextInfo;
```

### PF_GetFontStyleSheet

Retrieves font style sheet information for the fonts used in After Effects’ UI.

Trivia: The font used in After Effects’ UI starting in 15.0 is Adobe Clean. Before that, it was Tahoma on Windows and Lucida Grande on macOS X.

```cpp
PF_GetFontStyleSheet(
PF_FontStyleSheetsheet,
PF_FontName*font_nameP0,
A_short*font_numPS0,
A_short*sizePS0,
A_short*stylePS0);
```

### PF_SetCursor

Sets the cursor to any of After Effects’ cursors. See AE_EffectUI.h for a complete enumeration.

Set to:

- PF_Cursor_NONE` to allow After Effects to set the cursor.
- PF_Cursor_CUSTOM` if you’ve used OS-specific calls to change the cursor (After Effects will honor your changes).

```cpp
PF_SetCursor(
PF_CursorTypecursor);
```

### PF_IsRenderEngine

Returns TRUE if After Effects is running in watched folder mode, or is a render engine installation.

```cpp
PF_IsRenderEngine(
PF_Boolean*render_enginePB);
```

As of AE6.5, this function returns TRUE` if the installation is the render engine, or if the After Effects is being run with no UI, or if After Effects is in watched folder mode.

### PF_AppColorPickerDialog

Displays the After Effects color picker dialog (which may be the system color picker, depending on the user’s preferences).

Will return PF_Interrupt_CANCEL` if user cancels dialog. Returned color is in the project’s working color space.

```cpp
PF_AppColorPickerDialog(
constA_char*dialog_titleZ0,
constPF_PixelFloat*sample_colorP,
PF_PixelFloat*result_colorP);
```

### PF_GetMouse

Returns the position of the mouse in the custom UI coordinate space.

```cpp
PF_GetMouse(
PF_Point*pointP);
```

### PF_InvalidateRect

Queue up a [redraw](../effect-ui-events/custom-ui-and-drawbot.html) of a specific area of the custom UI for an effect.

Only valid while handling a non-drawing event in the effect.

Specify rectP0` as NULL` to invalidate the entire window. The redraw will happen at the next available idle moment after returning from the event.

Set the PF_EO_UPDATE_NOW` event outflag to update the window immediately after the event returns.

```cpp
PF_InvalidateRect(
constPF_ContextHcontextH,
constPF_Rect*rectP0);
```

### PF_ConvertLocalToGlobal

Converts from the custom UI coordinate system to global screen coordinates. Use only during custom UI event handling.

```cpp
PF_ConvertLocalToGlobal(
constPF_Point*localP,
PF_Point*globalP);
```

## Advanced Appsuite: You Can Do That?!

`PF_AdvAppSuite` was originally designed for some pretty nefarious purposes; an external application was pretending to be an After Effects plug-in, and required ways to notify After Effects of the changes it had made to the project. Our API impurity is your gain.

## PF_AdvAppSuite2

### PF_SetProjectDirty

Tells After Effects that the project has been changed since it was last saved.

```cpp
PF_SetProjectDirty(void);
```

### PF_SaveProject

Saves the project to the current path. To save the project elsewhere, use [AEGP_SaveProjectToPath()](../aegps/aegp-suites.html).

```cpp
PF_SaveProject(void);
```

### PF_SaveBackgroundState

Stores the background state (After Effects’ position in the stacking order of open applications and windows).

```cpp
PF_SaveBackgroundState(void);
```

### PF_ForceForeground

Brings After Effects to the front of all currently open applications and windows.

```cpp
PF_ForceForeground(void);
```

### PF_RestoreBackgroundState

Puts After Effects back where it was, in relation to other applications and windows.

```cpp
PF_RestoreBackgroundState(void);
```

### PF_RefreshAllWindows

Forces all After Effects windows to update. Note that although the Composition panel will be refreshed, this does not guarantee a new frame will be sent to External Monitor Preview plug-ins.

```cpp
PF_RefreshAllWindows(void);
```

### PF_InfoDrawText

Writes text into the After Effects info palette.

```cpp
PF_InfoDrawText(
constA_char*line1Z0,
constA_char*line2Z0);
```

### PF_InfoDrawColor

Draws the specified color in the After Effects info palette (alpha is ignored).

```cpp
PF_InfoDrawColor(
PF_Pixelcolor);
```

### PF_InfoDrawText3

Writes three lines of text into the After Effects info palette.

```cpp
PF_InfoDrawText3(
constA_char*line1Z0,
constA_char*line2Z0,
constA_char*line3Z0);
```

### PF_InfoDrawText3Plus

Writes three lines of text into the After Effects info palette, with portions of the second and third lines left and right justified.

```cpp
PF_InfoDrawText3Plus(
constA_char*line1Z0,
constA_char*line2_jrZ0,
constA_char*line2_jlZ0,
constA_char*line3_jrZ0,
constA_char*line3_jlZ0);
```

### PF_AppendInfoText

Appends characters to the currently-displayed info text.

```cpp
PF_AppendInfoText(
constA_char*appendZ0);
```

## Formatting Time

`PF_AdvTimeSuite` provides several functions to match how After Effects displays time. In fact, these are the same functions we use internally.

### PF_AdvTimeSuite4

#### PF_FormatTimeActiveItem

Given a time value and scale, returns a formatted string representing that time. If durationB is TRUE`, appropriate units will be appended.

```cpp
PF_FormatTimeActiveItem(
A_longtime_valueUL,
A_u_longtime_scaleL,
PF_BooleandurationB,
A_char*time_buf);
```

#### PF_FormatTime

Contextualizes the formatted time string for the given PF_InData and PF_EffectWorld (i.e., layer time).

```cpp
PF_FormatTime(
PF_InData*in_data,
PF_EffectWorld*world,
A_longtime_valueUL,
A_u_longtime_scaleL,
PF_BooleandurationB,
A_char*time_buf);
```

#### PF_FormatTimePlus

Allows you to select composition or layer time.

```cpp
PF_FormatTimePlus(
PF_InData*in_data,
PF_EffectWorld*world,
A_longtime_valueUL,
A_u_longtime_scaleL,
PF_Booleancomp_timeB,
PF_BooleandurationB,
A_char*time_buf);
```

#### PF_GetTimeDisplayPref

Returns the starting frame number (specified by the user in composition settings), and the composition’s time display preferences. Updated in 14.2 to support higher frame rates.

```cpp
PF_GetTimeDisplayPref(
PF_TimeDisplayPref2*tdp,
A_long*starting_num);
typedefstruct{
A_chardisplay_mode;
A_longframemax;
A_longframes_per_foot;
A_charframes_start;
A_Booleannondrop30B;
A_Booleanhonor_source_timecodeB;
A_Booleanuse_feet_framesB;
}PF_TimeDisplayPrefVersion3;
```

#### PF_TimeCountFrames

New in 15.0. Returns the index of the frame in the current comp.

```cpp
PF_TimeCountFrames(
constA_Time*start_timeTP,
constA_Time*time_stepTP,
A_Booleaninclude_partial_frameB,
A_long*frame_countL);
```

## Affecting The Timeline

Long ago, we helped a developer integrate their stand-alone tracker with After Effects by exposing a set of functions to give them some way to notify us of, and be notified of, changes to the timeline.

With the numerous AEGP API calls available, these aren’t used much, but they’re still available.

Don’t confuse this suite with [AEGP_ItemSuite](../aegps/aegp-suites.html) (#aegps-aegp-suites-aegp-itemsuite).

### PF_AdvItemSuite1

#### PF_MoveTimeStep

Moves current time num_stepsL in the specified direction.

```cpp
PF_MoveTimeStep(
PF_InData*in_data,
PF_EffectWorld*world,
PF_Steptime_dir,
A_longnum_stepsL);
```

#### PF_MoveTimeStepActiveItem

Moves num_stepsL in the specified direction, for the active item.

```cpp
PF_MoveTimeStepActiveItem(
PF_Steptime_dir,
A_longnum_stepsL);
```

#### PF_TouchActiveItem

Tells After Effects that the active item must be updated.

```cpp
PF_TouchActiveItem(void);
```

#### PF_ForceRerender

Forces After Effects to rerender the current frame.

```cpp
PF_ForceRerender(
PF_InData*in_data,
PF_EffectWorld*world);
```

#### PF_EffectIsActiveOrEnabled

Returns whether the effect which owns the PF_ContextH` is currently active or enabled (if it isn’t, After Effects won’t be listening for function calls from it).

```cpp
PF_EffectIsActiveOrEnabled(
PF_ContextHcontextH,
PF_Boolean*enabledPB);
```

## Accessing Auxiliary Channel Data

Some file types contain more than just pixel data; use `PF_ChannelSuite` to determine whether such information is present, and the macros in AE_ChannelSuites.h to retrieve it in the format you need.

### PF_ChannelSuite1

#### PF_GetLayerChannelCount

Retrieves the number of auxiliary channels associated with the indexed layer.

```cpp
PF_GetLayerChannelCount(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
PF_ParamIndexparam_index,
A_long*num_channelsPL);
```

#### PF_GetLayerChannelIndexedRefAndDesc

Retrieves (by index) a reference to, and description of, the specified channel.

```cpp
PF_GetLayerChannelIndexedRefAndDesc(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
PF_ParamIndexparam_index,
PF_ChannelIndexchannel_index,
PF_Boolean*foundPB,
PF_ChannelRef*channel_refP,
PF_ChannelDesc*channel_descP);
```

#### PF_GetLayerChannelTypedRefAndDesc

Retrieves an auxiliary channel by type. Returned information is valid only if foundPB` returns TRUE`.

```cpp
PF_GetLayerChannelTypedRefAndDesc(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
PF_ParamIndexparam_index,
PF_ChannelTypechannel_type,
PF_Boolean*foundPB,
PF_ChannelRef*channel_refP,
PF_ChannelDesc*channel_descP);
```

PF_DataType will be one of the following:

> - PF_DataType_FLOAT` - 34 bytes
> - PF_DataType_DOUBLE` - 38 bytes
> - PF_DataType_LONG` - 34 bytes
> - PF_DataType_SHORT` - 32 bytes
> - PF_DataType_FIXED_16_16` - 34 bytes
> - PF_DataType_CHAR` - 31 byte
> - PF_DataType_U_BYTE` - 31 byte
> - PF_DataType_U_SHORT` - 32 bytes
> - PF_DataType_U_FIXED_16_16` - 34 bytes
> - PF_DataType_RGB` - 3 bytes

PF_ChannelType will be one of the following:

> - PF_ChannelType_DEPTH`
> - PF_ChannelType_NORMALS`
> - PF_ChannelType_OBJECTID`
> - PF_ChannelType_MOTIONVECTOR`
> - PF_ChannelType_BK_COLOR`
> - PF_ChannelType_TEXTURE`
> - PF_ChannelType_COVERAGE`
> - PF_ChannelType_NODE`
> - PF_ChannelType_MATERIAL`
> - PF_ChannelType_UNCLAMPED`
> - PF_ChannelType_UNKNOWN`

#### PF_CheckoutLayerChannel

Retrieves the PF_ChannelChunk` containing the data associated with the given PF_ChannelRefPtr`.

```cpp
PF_CheckoutLayerChannel(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
PF_ChannelRefPtrchannel_refP,
longwhat_time,
longduration,
unsignedlongtime_scale,
PF_DataTypedata_type,
PF_ChannelChunk*channel_chunkP);
```

#### PF_CheckinLayerChannel

Checks in the PF_ChannelChunk`. Always, always, always check the data back in.

```cpp
PF_CheckinLayerChannel(
PF_ProgPtreffect_ref,
PF_ChannelRefPtrchannel_refP,
PF_ChannelChunk*channel_chunkP);
```
