`int sample_geometry(vector origin, vector sample, float time, ...)`

The sample_geometry operation in VEX is used to distribute a single sample
point on geometry objects in the scene, and to execute the surface shader at
that point. The operation is similar to the [trace](trace.html "Sends a ray
from P along the normalized vector D.") and [gather](gather.html "Sends rays
into the scene and returns information from the shaders of

surfaces hit by the rays.") functions in that it accepts a variadic argument
list of shader outputs to be exported by the operation. However,
`sample_geometry` is different from raytracing functions in that it does not
actually send a ray into the scene to determine where shaders should be run.
The origin and sample parameters have different meanings depending on the type
of distribution. time can be used with motion blur to distribute sample points
in time as well as in space.

### Area Distribution ¶

In this mode, points will be distributed over multiple primitives according to
their area. More samples will be placed on primitives with large surface areas
than on primitives with small surface areas. The sample parameter should
contain uniform random variables in the range of 0 to 1. The origin parameter
has no effect.

### Parametric Distribution ¶

In this mode, primitive and subdivision IDs along with parametric surface
coordinates are mapped to surface positions. This mode is useful when trying
to maintain a coherent set of surface positions (for example, in a point
cloud) across multiple frames because the same primitive ID, subdivision ID,
s, and t coordinates map to similar surface positions even when a mesh is
deforming. The sample parameter contains the s and t coordinates (in the first
and second components), while the origin parameter contains the primitive and
subdivision IDs (again, in the first and second components).

### Solid Angle Distribution ¶

This mode is similar to the “area” mode, except that points on a particular
primitive are distributed according to solid angle rather than area. More
specifically, samples will be distributed according to hemispherical coverage
relative to origin. The sample parameter should contain uniform random
variables in the range of 0 to 1.

### Details ¶

### Light inclusion/exclusion options ¶

## Arguments

"`categories`", `string` `="*"`

Specifies lights to include/exclude by their “category” tags. This is the
preferred include/exclude lights rather than pattern matching light names with
the `"lightmask"` keyword argument.

For example:

```c
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "hero fill");
```

See [light categories](../../render/lights.html#categories) for more
information.

"`lightmask`", `string` `="*"`

When evaluating light and shadow shaders, objects have pre-defined light
masks. This mask is usually specified in the geometry object and specifies a
list of lights which are used to illuminate a surface or fog shader. It is
possible to override the default light mask by specifying a “lightmask”
argument.

For example:

```c
diff = diffuse(nml, "lightmask", "light*,^light2");
```

…will cause all lights whose names begin with “light” except for a light named
“light2” to be considered for diffuse illumination.

All Houdini scoping patterns, excepting group expansion, are supported:

- `*` \- wild-card match

- `?` \- single character match

- `^` \- exclusion operator

- `[list]` \- character list match

### Ray options ¶

:::tip

When you specify a texture, such as with the `"environment"` keyword, you can
also use the image filtering keyword arguments. See
[environment](environment.html) "Returns the color of the environment
texture.") for a listing of the image filter keyword arguments.
:::

## Arguments

"`scope`", `string`

A list of objects which can be hit by the rays. When specified, `scope`
overrides the default scope that would have been selected for the given
`raystyle`. The `"scope:default"` value will cause the `scope` argument to use
the default scope for the current context - as if the argument were not
specified.

Allows an override of the [scope](../contexts/shading_contexts.html#scope) for
ray-intersections. A special scope argument, `scope:self`, will match the
currently shading object.

"`currentobject`", `material`

Used to specify what the current shading object is. For example, when used
with the scope argument, `scope:self` will match the object passed in by this
argument.

"`maxdist`", `float` `=-1`

The maximum distance to search for objects. This can be used to limit the
search of objects to nearby objects only. If the `maxdist` given is negative,
then it will act as if there is no maximum distance.

Allows an override of the maximum distance the ray can travel when testing for
intersections. Some functions (such as [fastshadow](fastshadow.html "Sends a
ray from the position P along the direction specified by the

direction D.")) have the maximum distance implicitly defined (by the length of
the ray) and should probably avoid using this option. However, this option can
be used effectively when computing reflections, global illumination,
refraction etc.

"`variancevar`", `string`

The name of a VEX export variable to use for variance anti-aliasing. The
renderer compares the value with adjacent micropolygons in micropolygon
rendering to decide what shading points need additional samples (using
`vm_variance` [property](../../props/index.html "Properties let you set up
flexible and powerful hierarchies of rendering, shading, lighting, and camera
parameters.") as a threshold). If more samples are required, the algorithm
takes samples up to the specified maximum ray samples.

This variable must be imported from the hit surface, so it must be in the list
of imported names (see “importing information back from the ray” below). If
the named variable is not imported, this option will be ignored.

Variance antialiasing puts more samples in areas of the image with high
variance, for example a sharp shadow edge. It is only used when
`vm_dorayvariance` is enabled. Otherwise, only the min ray samples (or an
explicitly supplied `"samples"` value) are used for antialiasing of the gather
loop.

Overrides the global variance control (mantra’s -v option) which is used to
determine anti-aliasing quality of ray tracing. For more information please
refer to the documentation on mantra.

"`angle`", `float` `=0`

The distribution angle (specified in radians). For gather(), rays will be
distributed over this angle. For trace(), the angle is used to indicate the
rate at which the filter width should increase with increasing intersection
distance. Larger angles will cause farther hit surfaces to use larger
derivatives, leading to improved texturing and displacement performance.

To be effective, the samples parameter should also be specified.

"`samples`", `int|float` `=1`

How many samples should be sent out to filter rays. For the irradiance and
occlusion functions, specifying a samples parameter will override the default
irradiance sampling.

"`environment`", `string`

If the ray sent out to the scene misses everything, then it’s possible to
specify an environment map to evaluate.

Using the ray’s direction, the environment map specified will be evaluated and
the resulting color will be returned. Most likely, it will be necessary to
specify a transform space for the environment map evaluations.

In the case of refractlight and trace the Of and Af variables will be set to 0
regardless of the background color specified. the resulting color.

When an environment map is specified, the filtering options from texture() are
also supported.

See [how to create an environment/reflection map](../../render/envmaps.html).

"`envobject`", `string`

If an environment map is used, the orientation of the environment map can be
specified by transforming the ray into the space of another object, light or
fog object in the scene. In Houdini, null objects can be used to specify the
orientation. For example:

```c
Cf = R*reflectlight(bias, max(R), "environment", "map.rat",
"envobject", "null_object_name");
```

"`envlight`", `string`

If an environment map is used, the orientation of the environment map can be
specified by transforming the ray into the space of a light in the scene.

"`envtint`", `vector`

If an environment map is used, tint it with this color.

"`background`", `vector`

If a ray misses all objects, use this as the background color of the scene. In
the case of refractlight and trace the Of and Af variables will be set to 0
regardless of the background color specified.

"`distribution`", `string`

**Functions** : [irradiance](irradiance.html "Computes irradiance (global
illumination) at the point P with the normal N."), [occlusion](occlusion.html "Computes ambient occlusion.")

Distribution for computing irradiance. The default is to use a cosine
distribution (diffuse illumination). The possible values for the style are
`"nonweighted"` for uniform sampling or `"cosine"` for cosine weighted
sampling.

### Ray sending options ¶

## Arguments

"`width`", `float` `=-1`

Specifies the filter width at the source of the ray. If `angle` is also
specified, the filter width will become larger with increasing distance along
the ray. By default, the filter width will be initialized from the current
shading context, so it’s normally not necessary to specify `width` directly.
Negative values are ignored and will also cause the filter width to be
initialized from the current shading context.

"`distribution`", `string` `="cosine"`

Determines the sampling distribution.

For [gather](gather.html "Sends rays into the scene and returns information
from the shaders of

surfaces hit by the rays."):

- `cosine` – Rays are distributed by the cosine (diffuse) function over the hemisphere.

- `uniform` – Rays are distributed uniformly over the hemisphere

For [sample_geometry](sample_geometry.html "Samples geometry in the scene and
returns information from the shaders of surfaces that were sampled."):

- `area` – Samples are distributed by primitive area

- `parametric` – Samples are distributed by primitive ID, subdivision ID, and parametric surface coordinates (s, t).

- `solidangle` – Samples are distributed either by primitive area or by primitive area and solid angle subtended by the primitive.

"`biasdir`", `vector` `=Ng`

Overrides the bias direction when **Bias Along Normal** is enabled. When no
`biasdir` is specified, the geometric normal `Ng` is used. When bias along
normal is disabled, this option has no effect.

"`SID`", `int` `=0`

Sample identifier to be passed to the called shader. If the calling shader has
used SID to generate samples, it can be useful to pass the modified sample
identifier to the called shader so that it can begin sampling at the specified
offset. This value will be used to initialize the SID global in the hit
surface.

"`rayweight`", `float` `=1`

A hint to mantra to indicate the relative contribution of this ray to the
final shading. This value is used by the ray clip threshold to limit sending
of rays (similar to ray bounce).

"`raystyle`", `string` `="refract"`

The type of rays you are sending. Mantra will use `raystyle` to determine both
the default raytracing mask and bounce limit used for ray termination.

- `reflect` – Sending reflection rays. Mantra will use the reflection mask and reflection limit to terminate raytracing.

- `refract` – (default) Sending refraction rays. Mantra will use the refraction mask and refraction limit to terminate raytracing.

- `diffuse` – Sending diffuse rays. Mantra will use the diffuse limit for diffuse rays.

- `shadow` – Sending shadow rays. Mantra will not modify the raytracing level and will trace against `shadowmask` if inside a shadow or light shader.

- `primary` – Sending primary rays. This style can be used when a shader needs to change the direction of a primary ray without affecting the behavior of render settings that apply only to directly visible objects (such as matte and phantom). Mantra will still increment the raytracing level when sending `primary` rays.

- `nolimit` – Sending reflection rays with no limit on the number of raytracing bounces. Mantra will still increment the raytracing level when sending `nolimit` rays.

"`categories`", `string`

A category expression used to select the objects which can be hit by rays.
When specified, this overrides the existing `reflectcategories` and
`refractcategories` parameters.

For example, `^hidden` will hit all objects which do not have the hidden
category, and `shiny|happy` will hit all objects with either the shiny or
happy category.

The intersection of the scope and categories parameters are used to choose the
objects which can be hit by rays.

"`samplebase`", `float` `=0`

Typically, rays are distributed over the surface of the micro-polygon being
shaded. This argument can be used to control the area. A value of 0 will force
all rays to be sent from the same point. A value of 1 will cover the entire
micro-polygon. (Gather only)

"`transparentsamples`", `int` `=1`

The number of transparent samples to take for stochastic transparency with
array outputs. Normally this value should be set to 1 unless you have
requested exports in array variables - in which case the ray tracer will
insert an entry in the array for each sample along the ray.

::: info Note
`transparentsamples` must be 1 when importing `F` or `ray:material` using
`screendoor` `samplefilter`.
:::

### Sending information to the surface’s shader ¶

Using a keyword in the form `"send:name", value`, you can pass data from the
originating surface to surfaces which are intersected by the ray. These
arguments pass any values you want.

```c
gather(P, dir, "send:N", normalize(N)) { ... }
```

You can extract this passed data on the receiving end (that is, in the surface
being hit by the ray) with the [rayimport](rayimport.html "Imports a value
sent by a shader in a gather loop.") function. The first argument is the name
(without the `send:` prefix) and the second argument is a variable in which to
store the imported value.

`int rayimport(string name, <type> &value)`

`rayimport` returns `1` if the value was imported successfully.

### Importing information from the ray ¶

You can specify names of global or exported variables to import from the hit
shader in the form `"varname", &var`, typically including `Cf` (color vector
of surface hit) and `Of` (opacity vector of surface hit).

```c
vector hitcf; gather(P, dir, "bias", 0.01, "Cf", hitcf) {...}
```

In addition, you can import the following special keywords to get information
about the ray itself:

## Arguments

"`ray:origin`", `&vector`

The origin of the ray (defined in `else` clause also).

"`ray:direction`", `&vector`

The direction of the ray (defined in `else` clause also).

"`ray:length`", `&float`

The distance to the first surface which was hit by the ray.

"`ray:area`", `&float`

The total surface area of all the geometry in the raytracing scope.

"`ray:solidangle`", `&float`

The estimated solid angle subtended by all geometry in the raytracing scope.
For large objects close to or enclosing the ray origin, this may be a very
poor estimate while for individual primitives the estimate can be very good.

You can retrieve information about more than one hit along the ray by
requesting data in an array variable. When an imported value is of an array
type, the [trace](trace.html "Sends a ray from P along the normalized vector
D.") function will automatically append an entry in the array for each
individual hit point that was composited during ray tracing. For the `opacity`
sample filter (see below), an entry will be created in the array for each
semi-transparent sample encountered until full opacity is reached. When using
array outputs, it may also be useful to use the `all` sample filter, which
will cause all hits along the ray to be inserted regardless of whether the
opacity limit was exceeded.

```c
// Find the position and normal for all hit points along the ray, //
regardless of visibility. vector a_pos[]; vector a_nml[]; trace(P, dir, Time,
"samplefilter", "all",  "P", a_pos,  "N", a_nml);
```

### Sample filtering options ¶

By default, Houdini composites the global variables using opacity blending. In
some cases, it’s more useful to get the value from the closest surface
(regardless of whether it’s transparent). You can use the special
`samplefilter` keyword with a string value of either `closest` or `opacity` to
control whether the value of a global is from the closest surface or opacity
blended.

## Arguments

"`samplefilter`", `string`

When the `samplefilter` keyword is encountered in the argument list, _all
following_ import variables will use the specified filtering mode. You can
specify multiple `samplefilter` arguments in a single gather statement to
filter different variables in different ways.

The current types of allowed for `samplefilter` are

`minimum`

Take the minimum value of all the samples. Note that with tuple values, the
minimum value of each component will be used.

`maximum`

Take the maximum value of all the samples. Note that with tuple values, the
maximum value of each component will be used.

`opacity`

Composite samples using the over operation.

`closest`

This is the default behavior, returning only the closest surface.

`screendoor`

Use stochastic compositing of the samples.

`sum`

Return the sum of the values for all samples.

`sum_square`

Return the sum of the squares of the values of all samples.

`sum_reciprocal`

Return the sum of the reciprocals of each sample.

::: info Note
When using [sample_geometry](sample_geometry.html "Samples geometry in the
scene and returns information from the shaders of surfaces that were
sampled."), the default `samplefilter` is set to `closest` by default, since
opacity blending only works when compositing data along a ray.
:::

```c
gather(P, dir,  "samplefilter", "opacity",  "Cf", hitCf,  "Of", hitOf,
"samplefilter", "closest",  "P", hitP,  "N", hitN) { trace(pos, dir, time,  //
Composite the bsdf of the hit surfaces using stochastic transparency
"samplefilter", "screendoor",  "F", hitF,  // But find the closest sample's
position "samplefilter", "closest",  "P", hitP); }
```

### Pipeline options ¶

## Arguments

"`pipeline`", `string`

As you specify variables, you can intersperse `pipeline` keyword options to
control where in the pipeline to fill out read/write variables. The value can
be one of `surface`, `atmosphere`, or `displacement`. You can specify the
`pipeline` option multiple times. Each use of the option affects any variables
specified after it (up to the next usage of `pipeline` if any).

```c
gather(p, d, "pipeline", "surface", "Cf", surfCf,  "pipeline",
"atmosphere" "Cf", fogCf, "P", hitP)
```

## Examples ¶

The following example demonstrates how `sample_geometry` can be used to
illuminate one surface from another. Rather than using a light source,
illumination is gathered from other surfaces in the scene named
`/obj/sphere_object*` and will illuminate any surfaces with the geolight
surface shader assigned.

A few observations about the shader:

- The `ray:solidangle` output is used to scale back geometry sample contributions by the solid angle subtended by the hit surface. This ensures that the result of using sample_geometry will match physically based irradiance.

- The [trace](trace.html "Sends a ray from P along the normalized vector D.") instruction is used for shadowing

- High-quality sampling patterns from [newsampler](newsampler.html "Initializes a sampling sequence for the nextsample function.") and [nextsample](nextsample.html) are used for antialiasing

```c
surface geolight(int nsamples = 64) { vector sam;  vector clr, pos;
float angle, sx, sy;  int sid;  int i;  sid = newsampler();  Cf = 0;  for (i =
0; i < nsamples; i++)  { nextsample(sid, sx, sy, "mode", "qstrat");  sam =
set(sx, sy, 0.0);  if (sample_geometry(P, sam, Time,  "distribution",
"solidangle",  "scope", "/obj/sphere_object*",  "ray:solidangle", angle, "P",
pos, "Cf", clr))  { if (!trace(P, normalize(pos-P), Time,  "scope",
"/obj/sphere_object*",  "maxdist", length(pos-P)-0.01))  { clr *= angle /
(2*PI);  clr *= max(dot(normalize(pos-P), normalize(N)), 0);  } else clr = 0;
} Cf += clr;  } Cf /= nsamples; }
```
