## Description

`int [] expandedgegroup(<geometry>geometry, string groupname)`

`int [] expandedgegroup(<geometry>geometry, string groupname, string mode)`

Returns a list of point pairs of the edges in the specified group of a
geometry file.

This can use ad-hoc groups, like `0` or `p0-1`. It matches the SOP group
naming convention, in particular that an empty string means all edges.

`mode` can be `ordered`, `unordered` or `split`. `ordered` is the default mode
and will return numbers in the order of appearance in the string, but only for
numbers. The order won’t be kept when using expressions such as `@Cd.x>0.5`.
The same number won’t appear twice in returned array. `unordered` mode returns
the resolved group following sorted point numbers order. `split` mode starts
by splitting the `groupname` string on `@` characters and then does one
resolution per sub string. The order is kept between the sub strings, but will
fallback to unordered when resolving a group expression. This same number can
appear multiple time when resolving using this mode.
