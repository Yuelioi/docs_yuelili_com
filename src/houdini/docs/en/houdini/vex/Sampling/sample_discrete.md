## Description

`int sample_discrete(int nvalues, float u)`

`int sample_discrete(float weights[], float u)`

## Arguments

`nvalues`

The returned integer will be uniform in the range `[0,nvalues-1]`, returning 0
if `u==0`, and returning `nvalues-1` if `u==1`. The output will be clamped to
that range in case `u` is out of the range `[0,1)`, to reduce the risk of
roundoff on `u` causing problems.

`weights`

Relative weights, (the sum does not need to be 1), of each integer value in
the range `[0,len(weights)-1]`.

`u`

A number between 0 and 1.

Returns an integer, based on `u`, either uniformly weighted from 0 to
`nvalues-1`, or weighted based on the `weights` array from 0 to
`len(weights)-1`. Given uniform random `u` values in `[0,1)`, the version
taking `nvalues` will return uniform random integers in `[0,nvalues-1]`, and
the version taking `weights` will return random integers in
`[0,len(weights)-1]`, where the probability of `i` is
`weights[i]/sum_of_weights`.
