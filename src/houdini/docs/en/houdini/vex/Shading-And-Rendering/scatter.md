`int scatter(vector ipoint, vector inormal, vector idirection, vector idistribution, float time, float maxdist, vector &opoint, vector &onormal, vector &odirection)`

Evaluates a single scattering event through geometry. A return value of 1
means the scattering was successful.

## Arguments

`ipoint`

Entry point of scattering.

`inormal`

Surface normal at the entry point (surfaces only). Required to orient the
scattering plane.

`idirection`

Primary scattering direction at the entry point. Required to orient the
scattering plane.

`idistribution`

Initial scatter distribution at the entry point. If a zero-valued vector is
passed a random scatter distribution will be used.

`maxdist`

Maximum distance to scatter.

`opoint`

Exit point of scattering.

`onormal`

Normal at the scattering exit point (surfaces only).

`odirection`

Outgoing direction at the scattering exit point (surfaces only).

```c
// Trace for intersection with scene vector hitP = 0; vector hitN = 0;
int hit = trace(P, I, Time, "P", hitP, "N", hitN);  // Scatter a random
distance from the intersection vector idistribution = 0; int sid = israytrace
? SID : newsampler(); vector s; nextsample(sid, s.x, s.y, "mode",
"nextpixel"); float maxdist = 2.0 * s.x; vector opoint = 0; vector onormal =
0; vector odirection = 0; hit = scatter(hitP, hitN, I, idistribution, Time,
maxdist, opoint, onormal, odirection);  // Trace again from the exit point of
the scattering hit = trace(opoint, odirection, Time, "P", hitP, "N", hitN);
