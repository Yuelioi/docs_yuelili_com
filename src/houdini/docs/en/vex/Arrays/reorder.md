## Description

`string reorder(string value, int indices[])`

Returns a reordered version of the _characters_ (not bytes) in the UTF-8
string `value` according to the positions in `indices`. The result is a UTF-8
encoded string.

`<type>[] reorder(<type>values[], int indices[])`

Returns a reordered version of the items in `values` according to the
positions in `indices`.

This usually uses a list of indices generated by [argsort](argsort.html) "Returns the indices of a sorted version of an array."). See the
[argsort](argsort.html) "Returns the indices of a sorted version of an array.")
page for an example.

- Negative numbers in the index list will read from the end of the array.

- The length of the resulting array/string is the same as the length of the `indices`.

- Out of bound values will insert zeros, but this should be considered an error.
