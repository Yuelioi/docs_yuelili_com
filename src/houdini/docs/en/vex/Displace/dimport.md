## Description

Context(s) [fog](../contexts/fog.html) [light](../contexts/light.html) [
shadow](../contexts/shadow.html) [surface](../contexts/surface.html)

`int dimport(string name, <type>&out)`

Reads a variable from the displacement shader for the surface.

Mantra runs the shaders for a surface in a fixed order:

1. Displacement

2. Surface (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)

3. Fog (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)

Once the displacement shader has run, you can use `dimport` to retrieve
exported variables from it. Once the surface shader has run, you can use
[simport](simport.html "Imports a variable sent by a surface shader in an
illuminance loop.") to retrieve exported variables from it.

If the shader variable named by the first argument is defined and exported,
the function returns 1 and puts the value in the second argument. Otherwise,
it returns 0.
