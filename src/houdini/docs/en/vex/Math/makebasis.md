## Description

`void makebasis(vector &xaxis, vector &yaxis, vector zaxis)`

`void makebasis(vector &xaxis, vector &yaxis, vector zaxis, vector u)`

Completes an orthonormal basis for the given `zaxis` vector consisting of the
`xaxis` and `yaxis` basis vectors. When only the `zaxis` vector is given, the
basis will have an arbitrary orientation. When a second vector `u` is
provided, the `yaxis` vector will be constrained so that it is aligned with
that vector.
