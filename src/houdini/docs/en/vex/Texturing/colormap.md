## Description

This function does bilinear interpolation of the pixel values. To get
unfiltered pixel values, use [rawcolormap](rawcolormap.html "Looks up an
unfiltered color from a texture file.").

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, vector uvw, ...)`

Uses the first two components of uvw as unit (0-1) coordinates to point sample
the texture file.

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, float u, float v, ...)`

Uses u and v as unit (0-1) coordinates to point sample the texture file.

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, vector uv, vector du, vector dv, int samples, ...)`

Uses the quadrilateral formed by `(uv)-(uv+du)-(uv+du+dv)-(uv+dv)` to area
sample the texture file. Takes samples number of stochastic samples (unless
the image is a .rat file).

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, vector uv0, vector uv1, vector uv2, vector uv3, ...)`

Uses the quadrilateral formed by `(uv0)-(uv1)-(uv2)-(uv3)` to area sample the
texture file.

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, vector uv0, vector uv1, vector uv2, vector uv3, int samples, ...)`

Uses the quadrilateral formed by `(uv0)-(uv1)-(uv2)-(uv3)` to area sample the
texture file. Takes samples number of stochastic samples (unless the image is
a .rat file).

`vector|vector4 colormap(string filename, float u0, float v0, float u1, float v1, float u2, float v2, float u3, float v3, int samples, ...)`

Uses the quadrilateral formed by `(uv0)-(uv1)-(uv2)-(uv3)` to area sample the
texture file. Takes samples number of stochastic samples (unless the image is
a .rat file).

## Arguments

## Returns

If you call the function with a `vector4` return type, the fourth component is
the alpha channel of the texture. If the image does not have alpha, the fourth
component is always `1`.

### Image filtering options ¶

Examples of specifying filter parameters:

```c
colormap(map, u, v, "smode", "decal", "tmode", "repeat", "border",
{.1,1,1}); colormap(map, u, v, "mode", "clamp", "width", 1.3); colormap(map,
u, v, "filter", "gauss", "width", 1.3, "mode", "repeat");
```

If the texture is a deep `.rat` file, you can use the `"channel"` keyword
argument to specify a channel in the file:

```c
string channelname = "N"; cf = colormap(map, u, v, "channel",
channelname);
```

- When you read a texture in a format other than Houdini’s native `.pic` or `.rat`, Houdini uses [OpenImageIO ###](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenImageIO) to read the image data from the file. In that case, some of the variadic arguments below may not have any effect.

- When the texture function evaluates non-houdini format textures, Houdini switches to use OpenImageIO for texture evaluation. While there are corresponding values to many of the variadic keywords, some keywords don’t have an equivalent function in OpenImageIO.

  - OIIO will _not_ create MIP maps for images that don’t have multi-resolution images by default. You can turn this on by adding `automip=1` to the content of the the `OPENIMAGEIO_IMAGECACHE_OPTIONS` environment variable.

Without MIP maps, blurring and filtering may not work as expected.

    * You can also use `OPENIMAGEIO_IMAGECACHE_OPTIONS` to override the amount of memory OIIO uses for caching.

By default, Houdini will set the cache memory to 1/8th of the physical
computer memory. If you set the `OPENIMAGEIO_IMAGECACHE_OPTIONS` variable it
overrides that computed cache size.

## Arguments

"`wrap`", `string` `="repeat"`

`repeat` or `periodic`

The image map will repeat outside the range 0 to 1. Basically, the integer
component of the texture coordinate is ignored. This is the default.

`clamp` or `edge` or `streak`

The texture coordinates will be clamped to the range 0 to 1. This causes
evaluations outside the range to evaluate to the color at the closest edge of
the image (the border pixels are streaked outside the range).

`black` or `decal` or `color`

Coordinates outside the range 0 to 1 will evaluate to the border color (rather
than a color in the image). The border color is black (i.e. 0) by default.

"`uwrap`", `string`

(AKA `swrap`) Specifies the behavior when the u coordinate is outside the
range 0 to 1. The values are the same as with `wrap`.

"`vwrap`", `string`

(AKA `twrap`) Specifies the behavior when the v coordinate is outside the
range 0 to 1. The values are the same as with `wrap`.

|"`border`", `float|vector|vector4` `=0`|

Specifies the border color when Black/Decal/Color wrapping is used. **Has no
effect for OpenImageIO formats**.

"`channel`",

Specifies the color channel for textures that have multiple color planes (for
example, `diffuse_indirect` or `N`). For ptex images, this specifies the index
of the first channel (for example, `0` or `4`).

"`blur`", `float`

Blurs in x and y directions. Blur is measured as a percentage of the image
size - so a blur of 0.1 will blur 10% of the image width. Use `xblur` and
`yblur` if you need different blur amounts in either dimension.

"`xblur`",

(AKA `ublur`, `sblur`) Blur amount in the x image direction.

"`yblur`",

(AKA `vblur`, `tblur`) Blur amount in the y image direction.

"`pixelblur`", `float`

Blurs the texture by a floating point number of pixels. **Has no effect for
OpenImageIO formats**.

```c
Cf = texture("map.rat", ss, tt, "pixelblur", 2.0);
```

"`xpixelblur`", `float`

Blurs the texture by a floating point number of pixels in the X direction.

"`ypixelblur`", `float`

Blurs the texture by a floating point number of pixels in the Y direction.

"`filter`", `string` `="box"`

Specifies the type of anti-aliasing filter to be used for evaluation.

**For Houdini native formats** , the following value should be a string
specifying one of:

`"point"`

Point sampling (i.e. no filtering)

`"box"`

Box filter (default)

`"gauss"`

Gaussian filter

`"bartlett"`

Bartlett/Triangular filter

`"sinc"`

Sinc sharpening filter

`"hanning"`

Hanning filter

`"blackman"`

Blackman filter

`"catrom"`

Catmull-Rom filter

**For all other formats (loaded by OpenImageIO)** , specifying the `"point"`
filter sets the OIIO interpolation mode to `"closest"` and disables MIP
mapping. Any other value uses OIIO smart-bicubic interpolation. You can get
finer control using the `"filtermode"` variadic argument (see below).

"`xfilter`", `string`

(AKA `ufilter`, `sfilter`) Specifies the filter for the X direction. The
filters are the same as with `filter`.

"`yfilter`", `string`

(AKA `vfilter`, `tfilter`) Specifies the filter for the Y direction. The
filters are the same as with `filter`.

"`filtermode`", `string`

**For Houdini native formats** , VEX also supports simpler filtering. The
`filtermode` can be set to one of:

`filter`

Use the filter specified by the `filter` keyword argument.

`bilinear`

Use simple bilinear filtering. This is the fastest specialized filtering mode,
but provides the lowest quality filtering.

`biquadratic`

Use simple quadratic filtering (order 3 filtering).

`bicubic`

Use simple bicubic filtering.

When the `filtermode` is set to `bilinear`, `biquadratic` or `bicubic`,
several arguments (like `filter` and `width`) are ignored and a fixed
interpolation filter is used instead. Other arguments (notably the `lerp` and
`blur` keywords) are still valid.

**For all other formats (loaded by OpenImageIO)** you can set the `filtermode`
to `"filter"` (see `"filter"` above), `"bilinear"`, `"biquadratic"`, or
`"bicubic"`.

"`width`", `float` `=1.0`

**For Houdini native formats** , this sets the filter width in both X and Y
directions.

**For all other formats (loaded by OpenImageIO)** , this sets the OIIO
`swidth` and `twidth` options.

"`xwidth`", `float`

(AKA `uwidth`, `swidth`) Filter width in the X direction.

"`ywidth`", `float`

(AKA `vwidth`, `twidth`) Filter width in the Y direction.

"`zwidth`", `float`

Filter width in the Z direction (for shadow maps). This is measured in world
space units, unlike the other width arguments.

"`extrapolate`", `int`

whether to use derivative extrapolation when computing anti-aliasing
information. Extrapolation of derivatives is on by default. The argument
should be either 0 or 1.

"`lerp`", `int`

**For Houdini native formats** , this specifies whether RAT files should
interpolate between different MIP levels. By default, this is turned off.
Turning interpolation on will help remove discontinuities when different MIP
levels of a `.rat` file are accessed. However, the results of texture
evaluation will be slightly softer (i.e. blurrier) and will take more time.

There are three possible values for this argument.

`0`

Disable MIP map interpolation (fastest).

`1`

Approximate MIP map interpolation (fast).

`2`

High Quality MIP map interpolation (slower but highest quality).

**For all other formats (loaded by OpenImageIO)** , a value of 0 specifies a
single MIP level, any other value specifies trilinear interpolation.

"`depthinterp`", `string`

Specifies the depth interpolation mode for deep shadow maps, to control the
opacity value that will be returned when the map is sampled between two
z-records.

The argument must be a string.

`discrete`

(default) Return the first z-record before the sample point.

`linear`

Linearly interpolate the opacities of the z-records before and after the
sample point.

See [deep shadow maps](../../render/lights.html) for more on the difference
between the two modes.

"`beerlambert`", `int`

When evaluating volumetric deep shadow maps, this will enable Beer-Lambert
interpolation of opacity. Beer-Lambert is more a accurate but more expensive
form of interpolation.

The argument should be either 0 or 1.

"`srccolorspace`", `string`

Specifies the color space in which the texture is stored. When texture values
are accessed, they will be translated from this space into linear space for
rendering if needed.

`auto`

(default) Determine the source color space based on the file. Currently, this
will assume sRGB color space for 8-bit textures and linear for all other
textures.

`linear`

Transform to linear space. This currently only affects 8-bit textures, since
all others are assumed to be already in linear space. Use this option to force
linear interpretation of textures used for bump or displacement maps.

`sRGB`

Forcibly translate from sRGB color space to linear space regardless of the
bit-depth or number of channels in the the texture.

`rec709`

Convert from Rec709 color space to linear space.

`gamma22`

Convert from Gamma 2.2 color space to linear space.

"`face`",

When using a Ptex texture map, the `face` argument is used to specify the face
for ptexture lookup. **Has no effect for OpenImageIO formats**.

"`ptexorient`", `int`

When using Ptex textures, the implicit texture coordinates on polygons are
used as the interpolants for texture lookup (combined with the `face`).
However, different software may have different beliefs about winding and
orientation. This keyword argument allows you to control the interpretation of
orientation for Houdini polygons. The `ptexorient` expects an integer argument
which is composed of a bit-field

- bit 0×01: Complement the `s` coordinate

- bit 0×02: Complement the `t` coordinate

- bit 0×04: Swap the `s` and `t` coordinates

For example, a value of 6 (0×4|0×2) is equivalent to calling `texture(map, 1-t, s)` instead of `texture(map, s, t)`.

The default `ptexorient` is 0, which works correctly with the examples found
at <http://ptex.us>.

**Has no effect for OpenImageIO formats**.

"`iesnormalization`", `string` `="maxvalue"`

Select different methods of normalizing IES map’s output values when querying
via `environment()` function.

`none`

Use raw values scaled by the candela multiplier in the header.

`maxvalue`

(default) Normalized by the maximum value. This is legacy behavior used by
mantra’s default light shader.

`preserveenergy`

Normalized by values integrated over coverage angles, so that IES profile
affects shaping of the light while preserving its overall energy output.
